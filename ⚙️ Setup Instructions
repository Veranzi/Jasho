Jasho Backend — Built for hustlers, by hustlers.

⚡This README **briefs what you’re building, explains why it matters, how to run it, what’s in scope, and what’s next** — exactly what hackathon judges and future devs need.  

Do you want me to now spin up the **starter code (`main.py`, `db.py`, and `auth routes`)** so you can immediately run `uvicorn` and see Jasho’s backend alive?
