## üîê Environment & Backend

The backend is already provisioned. Integrations (e.g., auth, wallet, savings, Absa) should be configured in the providers or services layer once endpoints are available. This MVP uses local state via Providers and can be wired to HTTP clients later.

Where to add API calls:

- `lib/providers/auth_provider.dart`
- `lib/providers/user_provider.dart`
- `lib/providers/wallet_provider.dart`
- `lib/providers/savings_provider.dart`
- `lib/providers/gamification_provider.dart`

Add your base URL and HTTP client (e.g., `http` or `dio`) as needed and map responses to provider state.
